# Recipe-Site-Traffic 

Tasty Bytes is a company which is developing a search engine for recipes. The search engine helps people to find ways to to use up the limited supplies they had at home. On the homepage of the search engine, there is a recipe that is displayed each day. It is noticed that traffic to the rest of the website goes up by as much as 40% if a popular recipe is picked to display on the homepage. More traffic means more subscriptions so this is really important to the company.

The objectives of this project are:

To predict which recipes will lead to high traffic
To correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time
